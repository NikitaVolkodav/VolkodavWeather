# VolkodavWeather

I developed VolkodavWeather order to learn URLSession, REST API. I used [OpenWether](https://openweathermap.org/api) API all of my weather needs. I accessed current weather data, daily forecasts for any location including over 376,000 cities. Used URLSession for network data transfer tasks. 

When app starts, you can see city name, current temperature, minimum and maximum temperature, date and weather description. You can check the weather forecast of the city you want.
